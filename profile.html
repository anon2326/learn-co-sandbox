    <p>Hi there! I'm Jeffrey. I like to help, I live to play video games, and I love my cats. I studied Electrical Engineering at Brooklyn Tech where I learned about C++ and Java.(Though to be honest, I forgot the majority of it!)</p>

    <h3 class="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>
    <p>If you read the paragraph (if you call that a paragraph) above, it's kinda obvious that I enjoy playing video games. That is my main hobby to be honest... Though I also build model kits, watch anime, read manga, and cuddle up with my cats.</p>
